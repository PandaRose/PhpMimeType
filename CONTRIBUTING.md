# Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit just the modifications.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted in the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
  style and that all tests pass.
* Send the pull request.
* Check that the Travis CI build passed. If not, rinse and repeat.
* For communication with contributors you can use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dfridrich/PhpMimeType).
* Use [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) like this ``` php-cs-fixer fix . --level=psr2 ```
